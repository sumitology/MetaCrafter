NFT Minting Script

This repository contains a simple JavaScript implementation for minting and managing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The script includes functions to create NFT objects, list their metadata, and display the total supply of minted NFTs.

Assessment Requirements

-Create a variable that can hold a number of NFTs: The variable is an array that will store multiple NFT objects.

-Create an object inside your mintNFT function: The function takes metadata values as parameters and creates an NFT object, which is then stored in the array.

-Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata: The function iterates over the array of NFTs and prints each NFT's metadata to the console.

-getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFTs you have created: The function prints the total number of NFTs minted.
